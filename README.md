# Currency-Converter
This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a currency converter application. It relies on an API to fetch real-time exchange rates. Users can input an amount in one currency and select another currency to convert. The application dynamically updates the converted amount based on the latest exchange rates. The user interface is designed with CSS for a pleasant user experience. To use the converter, simply open the HTML file in a web browser. Ensure an internet connection is available to fetch the latest exchange rates from the API. Refer to the code comments for customization and further understanding.
